# Arkanoid

Implementation of Arkanoid game in Java.</br>
Game was written by me in October 2009.</br>

The game has 4 levels that are described in levels.xml file.</br>
You can add as many new levels as you like, but pay attention to xml syntax and (x,y) coords.

Speed of ball increases over time.</br> 
Game also has some bonuses like:
<ul>
    <li>Life + / Life -</li>
    <li>Ball speed up / Ball speed down</li>
    <li>Add extra ball</li>
    <li>Increase / Decrease stick length</li>
    <li>Increase / Decrease ball radius</li>
</ul>
